<p></p><p><strong>Pro Login User Management System</strong> is a 
powerful PHP script designed to allow you to manage your users. The 
application is a great way to build your website, allowing your users to
 register an account and build restricted access to certain users. 
It&amp;rsquo;s powered by mysql and PHP and is built on the CodeIgniter 
platform.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the Pro Login User Management System. 
If you have any trouble setting up your system, feel free to contact us 
and we'll be happy to help get it going for you.</p>
<p></p>

<hr>


<h3 id="document-162">Simple Setup - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Installing the software is simple. You'll need the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>FTP Details</li>
	<li>MYSQL database details (username, password, database).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Uploading Files</h1>

<ul>
	<li>First locate the core files in the folder: <strong>core_files/core.zip </strong>and extract them.</li>
	<li>Upload the files to your main web directory. A sub folder is fine too.</li>
	<li>CHMOD the following files temporarily to <strong>0777</strong>: <strong>application/config/config.php</strong>, <strong>application/config/database.php</strong> and <strong>.htaccess</strong> (in the root folder).</li>
	<li>Run the <strong>setup.php</strong> file in the main document of the file. So if you installed your site in <strong>http://www.example.com/mysite/</strong>, you would run <strong>http://www.example.com/mysite/setup.php</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/step1.png" style="height:769px; width:1181px"></p>

<ul>
	<li>Follow the step by step instructions that allow you to setup the system.</li>
	<li>If you have issues using the setup.php file, please refer to the <strong>Setup &amp; Installation document</strong> which will give you a step by step guide of setting up the system manually.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want a more detailed install guide which explains everything 
more clearly, check out our Setup &amp; Installation document.</p>

<h2>How to CHMOD</h2>

<p>CHMOD is the process of setting a file's read/write permissions. In 
order to run the setup.php, it needs to be able to write to 3 core files
 temporarily whilst you run the setup. You'll need to set the files 
above to 0777 which grants the setup the correct access. To CHMOD a 
file, you need to navigate to the file in your FTP and right click the 
file. You'll want to look for something like permissions, chmod, or 
properties. Here you'll be able to set the CHMOD value.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/chmod.png"></p>

<p>Once you have completed the setup, chmod the files back to their default of <strong>0644</strong>.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-163">Setup &amp; Installation - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<h1>Quick Setup</h1>

<p>If you want to run the quick setup file, please refer to the Simple 
Setup document. This file will quickly setup your system for you, all 
you need to do is provide the correct details for your website. If 
you're having trouble using the simple setup, follow this guide to 
manually run the setup.</p>

<h1>Uploading Files</h1>

<p>Once you have downloaded your file from the Envato Marketplace, you 
will need to extract the files from the ZIP file. You will need to 
upload the product core files to a webserver. First locate the core 
files in the folder: <strong>core_files/core.zip</strong>. You will need
 to extract the files from the zip and upload them so that these files 
are in your main directory on your webserver, usually this is the 
public_html folder. If you wish to upload them to a sub-folder, this is 
fine too- just make sure you read the footnotes about installing in a 
sub-folder.</p>

<p>Your webserver's main directory should look something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="Directory Structure" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/directory_structure.png"></p>

<h1>Config Settings</h1>

<p>Before you can use your product, you will need to edit the config files. First locate the config file in: <strong>application/config/config.php</strong> and open it up using a text editor such as notepad. The only line you should need to edit is the:</p>

<pre>$config['base_url']	= 'http://www.example.com/';</pre>

<p>Replace the http://www.example.com with your own domain name, making 
sure you keep the quotation tags around it as above. There are some 
other settings that you can also edit in this file if you feel the need 
to customise your product further but for a basic installation this is 
all you should need to edit. Save the file and overwrite the existing 
one on your webserver.</p>

<h1>Database Settings</h1>

<p>The second file you will need to edit is your database file. Find the file: <strong>application/config/database.php</strong>
 and open it up using a text editor like Notepad. You will need to edit 
the lines listed below with your own database login information. For the
 most part, host stays the same as localhost unless your web host 
specifies to you otherwise. You will need your database name, database 
username and database password.</p>

<pre>$db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';
$db['default']['username'] = 'your_username';
$db['default']['password'] = 'your_password';
$db['default']['database'] = 'database_name';
</pre>

<p>Once you have modified this file, save it and overwrite the existing one on your webserver.</p>

<p>Next you will need to execute the SQL file that came with the product
 download. This file will create the database tables that are used to 
store the data of your application. Usually you can import the SQL 
tables by using a database management system like PHPmyAdmin. The SQL 
file is located in <strong>core_files/database.sql</strong> in the product download.</p>

<p>To Import the file, login to your database management system, such as
 PHPmyAdmin. Make sure you are on the database that you named in the 
database.php config file then locate the Import Tab on PHPmyAdmin.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/import.png" style="height:867px; width:1096px"></p>

<p>Next select the browse button (as shown in the screenshot above) and locate the SQL file (<strong>core_files/database.sql</strong>) from your product download file. Next click the Go! button and you should now see database tables appear in the left sidebar.</p>

<h1>Mod Rewrite</h1>

<p>We use a URL routing trick called mod_rewrite. This is normally 
installed by default on most web servers and allows for URLS like: 
http://www.example.com/some/file/here/ instead of 
http://www.example.com/myfile.php.</p>

<p>If you don't have mod_rewrite settings enabled on your web server, 
you can still use the application by setting your index_page value to 
the following line in the <strong>application/config/config.php</strong> file:</p>

<pre>$config['index_page'] = 'index.php';</pre>

<p>This setting will make it so your URLs have index.php in them. 
However, the default setting is to remove this and assumes you have 
mod_rewrite enabled on your webserver.</p>

<h1>Creating the Admin Account and Setup Site</h1>

<p>Finally, you will need to run the install file in your web browser. A
 notification will pop-up on the site once you have filled out all the 
database settings and config settings linking you to the install file. 
Or you can locate it by going to <strong>http://www.example.com/install/</strong>
 where example.com is replaced by your own. Here you'll be able to 
create the Admin account with full access to the site as well as some 
initial site settings.</p>

<p>If you're having problems accessing this URL, double-check that you entered the correct information in the <strong>application/config/config.php</strong>
 file. If you are sure that it is correct, it may be something to do 
with your webserver's settings with allowing mod_rewrite. The problem 
most notably is usually with the <strong>.htaccess</strong> file in the 
main directory- make sure this file is in your main directory (like in 
the directory screenshot above). If you still have problems, check out 
our Knowlege Base or feel free to contact us.</p>

<p>If you added index.php to your config setting <strong>index_page </strong>in the<strong> </strong><strong>application/config/config.php</strong> file, the URL to install will be: <strong>http://www.mydomain.com/index.php/install/</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Once you have installed the product, please delete the file <strong>application/controllers/install.php</strong>! This will prevent other users from messing up your settings. Please also delete <strong>setup.php</strong> and <strong>setup_db.sql</strong> in the main directory.</p>

<h1>Installing In A Sub-Folder</h1>

<p>If you're installing the software in a sub-folder, such as 
http://www.example.com/my_subfolder/ then you will need to modify the 
.htaccess file inside the main directory (the one that holds the 
application, bootstrap folders etc). All you need to do is open up the 
.htaccess file in your text editor and copy the following code, 
replacing the sub-folder with the name of your sub-folder (in this 
example, the sub-folder is called sub_folder_name_here. Replace this 
with the name of your sub-folder).</p>

<pre>RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /sub_folder_name_here
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php?/$1 
</pre>

<p>Save the file as .htaccess and overwrite the one inside your main 
directory that you used to install the software in (the folder 
containing the application, bootstrap folders etc). You can skip this 
step if you're installing in your main folder.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-15">Application Structure - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>This application is built up around the CodeIgniter framework. 
CodeIgniter is built directly into the software, so you don't have to do
 anything extra to use it.</p>

<p>For developers, this framework is freely available on the internet 
and documentation for using the source code can be founded on their 
website: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a>.</p>

<p>CodeIgniter is a PHP Framework written in MVC (model-view-controller)
 format which allows developers to create applications that are 
structured in a very clean and efficient way. When you unzip the product
 download (core_files/code.zip), you will be presented with the 
following directory structure. Below is a quick overview of where you 
can find various files if you are new to using CodeIgniter.</p>

<p><img alt="Directory Structure" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/directory_structure.png" style="height:227px; width:205px"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>application</strong> - This is where the main application 
files are kept. It includes the configuaration files, the class 
controllers, models and view files. If you want to make changes to the 
application, you should modify these files.</li>
	<li><strong>bootstrap</strong> - The bootstrap Javascript and CSS files.</li>
	<li><strong>images</strong> - Images used in the application are stored here.</li>
	<li><strong>scripts</strong> - Custom Javascript files made for use with the application.</li>
	<li><strong>styles</strong> - Custom CSS files made for use with the application.</li>
	<li><strong>system</strong> - The core CodeIgniter files are present here. These should not be modified unless upgrading the CodeIgniter version.</li>
	<li><strong>uploads</strong> - This folder is used to store user uploads.</li>
	<li><strong>user_guide</strong> - Documentation on how to use CodeIgniter.</li>
	<li><strong>.htaccess</strong> - This file is used to tell your web server to process URLs.</li>
	<li><strong>index.php</strong> - The application bootup file.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information on directory structure at the CodeIgniter website and reading the User Guide: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a></p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-16">Where Everything Is - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>This part of the guide is to show you where the most common elements 
of the site are located. Remember, this site uses CodeIgniter Framework,
 so for well-documented additional support, please use their website and
 user guide: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a></p>

<h3>Styling &amp; CSS</h3>

<p>The site's styling is based off Bootstrap 3; Bootstrap 3 comes with 
lots of predefined CSS elements that you can use to create well 
presented websites with. You can view the Bootstrap documentation and 
examples here: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">http://getbootstrap.com/</a>. If you wish to upgrade the Bootstrap version or make your own changes to it, you can find the files in the <strong>bootstrap/</strong> directory.</p>

<p>The product also uses it's own custom styling to create the site layout. You can find the stylesheet file in <strong>styles</strong> folder.</p>

<h3>Modify HTML / Frontend interface</h3>

<p>The template files, also known as views, can be found in <strong>application/views/</strong>.
 These files contain the HTML of the site and modifying these files 
allows you to change the way the site presents data. These files also 
contain some PHP code so it's important to know what you're doing when 
editting these files.</p>

<p>The layout file can be found in <strong>application/views/layout/layout.php</strong>.</p>

<h3>PHP Logic &amp; Database Models</h3>

<p>The controller files, which contain the site logic, can be found in <strong>application/controllers/</strong> folder. These are PHP files that are used to control how the site works.</p>

<p>The model files can be found in <strong>application/models/</strong> which contain the database logic.</p>

<h3>Javascript &amp; Libraries</h3>

<p>The Javascript files can be found in the <strong>scripts/</strong> folder. The <strong>custom/</strong> folder contains custom made scripts for the site and the <strong>libraries/</strong> folder contains 3rd-party plugins that we use.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-17">Login And Register - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>When you have successfully installed the ProLogin system, you should 
be presented with a frontpage like the one below. This is the login 
screen that is presented to all your users. You can login by using the 
Email Address and Password that you created in the Install file.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_1.png"></p>

<p>Users can also login using their social network accounts for Twitter,
 Facebook and Google. You will first need to setup your social network 
keys before you can enable this option. View our Social Network setup 
guide in the documentation.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_2.png"></p>

<p>Also presented on this page is the register button. Clicking it takes
 you to the simple registration form that allows users to register on 
your site. You can disable registration in the Admin Panel.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-18">Dashboard - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The Dashboard is the welcoming page for logged in members. Here it 
gives you a quick overview of your site's stats, as well as some useful 
information regarding the newest members of your site and overall 
progress from the last 6 months. This information is cached, so it 
updates every couple of hours to save system resources.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_1.png"></p>

<p>This area shows you information on your User Base. It displays the 
newest registered users, the amount of users registered for the past 6 
months and also a breakdown of where your users are coming from.</p>

<p>You will also notice a sidebar which has some useful links that you 
can navigate. If you are logged in as an Admin user, you will notice the
 Admin Panel link. Clicking on it will expand the menu, presenting you 
with more options.</p>

<p>You can modify the HTML for this file in: <strong>application/views/home/index.php</strong>. The PHP login can be found in <strong>application/controllers/Home.php</strong>.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-19">Members - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>A members page is available for all your members to view.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_2.png"></p>

<p>You can view a user's username, when they joined, where they joined 
from and what kind of member they are. You can also click their username
 to go the user's profile.</p>

<p>You can sort the member list by clicking on the table column headers.
 Sort by Username, date joined, name, user level and provider.</p>

<p>You can also search members by using the top search bar at the top of the page. This allows you to search by Username.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-20">User Settings - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The User Settings page can be found by clicking on the Settings link. These settings are for each individual user.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/user_settings.png"></p>

<p>Here a user can upload an avatar, change their name and edit their About Me section which appears on their profile page.</p>

<p>A user can also change their password by clicking the Change Password button in the top right corner.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-21">Admin Panel - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The Admin Panel only shows to users with an Admin status account. You
 can create your Admin account by using the Installer as mentioned in 
the Install Guide above.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_6.png"></p>

<p>There are quite a lot of options for the Admin Panel that help 
running your site that much easier. The first set of options is the 
Global Settings option. These options directly effect the site overall. 
Here you can change the Site Name, Logo, Disable Registration and more.</p>

<p>Other settings include Social Settings. These settings refer to 
allowing users to login to your site using their Social Network 
Accounts. You will need to obtain API keys from the Social Networks, you
 can do this quite easily and for free. Just follow our Social Network 
guide that is contained within the documentation folder.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_9.png"></p>

<p>The Manage Member section is similar to the Members page. However, 
this section contains a bit more detail about your users, including 
their Email Address and the IP address used to sign up with the account.
 From this page, you can also Edit and Delete members. Clicking on Edit 
will present you with a page allowing you to edit the user's details, 
such as username, email and password.</p>

<h1>User Roles</h1>

<p>The system also employs a User Role system. User Roles have certain 
privliges to various areas of the site and you can create custom User 
Roles for your users.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_5.png" style="height:1080px; width:1920px"></p>

<p>Defined User Roles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Admin - complete access to every part of the site</li>
	<li>Member Manager - access to the Admin Panel's Manage Members section</li>
	<li>Admin Settings - access to the global settings and social settings pages</li>
	<li>Admin Payment - access to the payment settings in the Admin Panel</li>
</ul>

<p>You can create custom roles which incorporate two or three of these roles such as:</p>

<p>&nbsp;CUSTOM ROLE NAME: <strong>User Moderator</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;ROLES: Member Manager, Admin Payment</p>

<p>Then if a user has the <strong>User Moderator</strong> User Role, they would be able to manage the member section in the admin panel and the admin payment settings areas.</p>

<h1>Groups</h1>

<p>Another option included in the software is User Groups. This section 
allows you to create groups for your users, allowing you to keep them 
more organised. You can also use groups to restrict access to certain 
pages. We have made a test page for this and you can view the coding 
behind it by editing the file application/controllers/Test.php.</p>

<p>We also have an in-built IP blocking system. Here you can add IP 
Address to a blacklist which will prevent those IP addresses from 
registering new accounts and logging in.</p>

<p>Email Templates allow you to edit Emails that are sent out to users. 
There is currently only one email you need to be aware of and that is 
the Forgotten Password email. If you wish to change this email and the 
way it's presented, feel free to edit the Email using this area.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_7.png"></p>

<p>In the Admin Panel is also the ability to send out emails to your 
members. From the Email Members page, you can select individual users, 
user groups or all users. Then you can set the title of the email and of
 course, the email message you wish to send. Emails are sent using 
CodeIgniters in built email library. You can change the settings for how
 emails are sent using the email config found here: <strong>application/config/email.php</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="document-22">Creating Your Own Content - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>If you want to add your own custom code to the system, follow this 
guide. This guide is only if you wish to add pages/content/features 
using PHP.</p>

<p>Creating your own pages in PHP requires you to use the CodeIgniter 
framework. It's quite simple to use if you have some programming 
experience. You can view our test content file here: <strong>application/controllers/Test.php</strong></p>

<p>To create a page, first you will want to create a Controller file. 
This file will be where you main PHP code logic goes. Below is an 
example controller file. The file must be saved as the same name as the 
class (with a captial letter). So for example, the class here is called 
Example, so the controller file must be called Example.php. The file 
must be placed inside the application/controllers/ folder.</p>

<pre>&lt;?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

class Example extends CI_Controller 
{

	public function __construct() 
	{
		parent::__construct();
		$this-&gt;load-&gt;model("user_model");
		if(!$this-&gt;user-&gt;loggedin) {
			redirect(site_url("login"));
		}
	}

	public function index() 
	{
		$this-&gt;template-&gt;loadContent("example/index.php", array(
			)
		);
	}
}

?&gt;
</pre>

<p>The name of the Controller is also used to access the page. Since we 
named our controller Example, we can now access it using our URL like 
so: http://www.mysite.com/example/</p>

<p>There are a few more things to look at here too. If you notice inside the index() function, there is this line:</p>

<pre>$this-&gt;template-&gt;loadContent("example/index.php", array(
			)
		);
</pre>

<p>This line is saying to load the HTML file stored in 
application/views/example/index.php. If you want to create your own HTML
 files, you can. Simply create a folder inside the application/views/ 
folder. Name it whatever you like. For this example, let's call it 
example. Inside that folder, create your very own PHP file that will be 
used to display the HTML. Let's create a file called test.php and put 
some code inside it:</p>

<pre>Hello, this is a test! We save it as a .php file so that we can also include PHP code. Like this: 
</pre>

<p>Now, we need to edit our controller file 
application/controllers/Example.php to use our new HTML file that we 
just created. So edit the loadContent() function to use it, like so:</p>

<pre>$this-&gt;template-&gt;loadContent("example/test.php", array(
			)
		);
</pre>

<p>Now when you load the Example page, it will display the content inside application/views/example/test.php.</p>

<p>If you found that confusing, not to worry! There are thousands of 
guides out there that use the CodeIgniter framework. There is also the 
CodeIgniter Documentation, which gives a brilliant easy to understand 
overview of how to use the system. Don't forget to look at our own test 
file, which gives examples of how you can restrict access to pages 
(application/controllers/Test.php). You can also contact us via email if
 you need extra help.</p>

<h3 id="document-23">Modifying the HTML &amp; CSS - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>You can modify the HTML and CSS of the product to match the look and 
feel of your website. You can manually edit the CSS files that control 
the site's look and feel.</p>

<p>You can find the CSS file in <strong>styles/main.css</strong>. Here 
you will be able to see the current rules that have been created for the
 site. You may want to put your own rules at the bottom of the file, or 
even create your own CSS file and include that into the site layout. 
This will be useful should you ever wish to upgrade the product with a 
newer version and your settings won't be overwritten.</p>

<p>You may also wish to change the HTML of the site. All HTML files are inside the <strong>application/views/</strong> folders. The layout HTML file can be found in <strong>application/views/layout/layout.php</strong>.
 This file is the core of the site structure. There are some PHP coding 
inside the HTML files which is used to generate the dynamic content; we 
suggest not modifying these as it could cause unexpected errors in your 
system.</p>

<p>Remember, you can find out more information on how to use Views, 
Controllers and Models using the CodeIgniter framework by reading their 
documentation: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a></p>

<h3 id="document-58">Login Protect Pages - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>If you have some website pages outside of the system, you can include
 a small script into your file to make it so that users must be logged 
in to view it. Here's a detailed guide on how to do it.</p>

<p>1) Identify what files you want to be login protected. The files need
 to be PHP files, so if you have any HTML files you'll need to rename 
them with .php extensions. For example, about-us.html becomes 
about-us.php. The reason is so that the login protect script can check 
for a logged in user. It cannot do this on a regular HTML page.</p>

<p>2) Once you have the file, you'll need to locate two files in your download file. Open up <strong>zip/extra/login_checker/</strong> and you should see two files: <strong>index_check.php</strong> and <strong>login_checker.php</strong>.</p>

<p>3) You need to place <strong>index_check.php</strong> inside the root directory of your system (where the application, system and images folders are).</p>

<p>4) Next you need to open up your file that you want to protect and insert the code from <strong>login_checker.php</strong> into the top of the file. For example:</p>

<pre>
&nbsp;</pre>

<p>My page</p>

<p>Hello welcome to my page!</p>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;/* Login Checker Script */

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;/*

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This script can be used in your other files to check to make sure a user

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;is logged in.</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You just need to make sure that the file you add this script to is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PHP file. If you have a HTML file, you can simply rename it with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;.php extension.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you include this file from another directory, you'll need to uncomment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the $system_path and $application_folder lines.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*/</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ob_start();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;define("REQUEST", "external");</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;/* Directory paths<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Only change these if your files are outside the original directory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;of the application. Use&nbsp; for each folder you are out by.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By default, it uses the original CodeIgniter values.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*/<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// $system_path = "prologin/system";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// $application_folder = "prologin/application";</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include('prologin/index_check.php');<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ob_end_clean();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $CI =&amp; get_instance();</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(!$CI-&gt;user-&gt;loggedin) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;redirect(site_url("login"));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
?&gt;</p>

<p>My pageHello welcome to my page!</p>

<p>If your external file is outside of the system directory, you'll need to un-comment two variables in the php code:</p>

<pre>  $system_path = "prologin/system";
  $application_folder = "prologin/application";
</pre>

<p>And rename <strong>prologin</strong> to the folder in which the software is in.</p>

<p>Save the file and now whenever a user visits your page, the user will
 be automatically redirected to the login page if they are not already 
logged in. This allows you to protect many areas of your site and give 
access to your members.</p>

<p>Remember, if you need help setting this up, feel free to send in a Support Request!</p>

<h3 id="document-24">Languages - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>If you would like to translate your product into another language, 
then you can do so by modifying the language files. Follow the simple 
steps below to get started:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a new folder inside the application/language/ folder. Give 
the folder the name of your language, such as spanish, italian etc. For 
this example, I will call mine <strong>french</strong>.</li>
	<li>Copy the 3 files from inside application/language/english/ to the newly created folder that you just made.</li>
	<li>Inside your new language folder you should now have a <strong>content_lang.php</strong>, <strong>error_lang.php</strong> and <strong>success_lang.php</strong>. You can also add the index.html file too.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are now ready to begin editting these files.</p>

<p>The <strong>content_lang.php</strong> contains all translations for most of the content pages on the site. The <strong>error_lang.php</strong>
 file contains all the error messages that are given to users when they 
do something wrong. You are free to translate them all or just a few. 
The main one should be the content_lang.php as those translations are 
the ones your users will mostly see.</p>

<p>To edit the translations, all you need to do is type the new correct 
text inside the double quotes. For example, the following is a couple of
 lines from the content_lang.php file:</p>

<pre>			$lang['ctn_3'] = "Provide Us Feedback";
			$lang['ctn_4'] = "Email Address";
		</pre>

<p>To translate, you just need to modify the text within the double quotes. For example, a french translation would be:</p>

<pre>			$lang['ctn_3'] = "Fournir nous Commentaires";
			$lang['ctn_4'] = "Adresse e-mail";
		</pre>

<p>Save the file when your done. The final step for your translations to
 take place, you need to edit the application/config/config.php file. 
Change the following line:</p>

<pre>		$config['language']	= 'english';
		</pre>

<p>to the name of the folder that you stored your new language files in. In my case, it was french, so I change it to:</p>

<pre>		$config['language']	= 'french';
		</pre>

<p>Save config.php and you should see your new translations take place.</p>

<p><strong>Extra</strong></p>

<p>You may also need to add the System translation files. These files 
are for generic System errors. We recommend performing the following 
steps:</p>

<p>You&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;create&nbsp;a&nbsp;folder&nbsp;in&nbsp;your&nbsp;Systems&nbsp;language&nbsp;folder&nbsp;for&nbsp;your&nbsp;new&nbsp;language.
 The folder name needs to be the same name as your new language. In the 
example below, it's "<strong>spanish</strong>". Please&nbsp;follow&nbsp;these&nbsp;steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1)&nbsp;Create&nbsp;a&nbsp;folder&nbsp;inside&nbsp;system/language/&nbsp;called&nbsp;<strong>spanish</strong></li>
	<li>2)&nbsp;Locate&nbsp;the&nbsp;following&nbsp;folder:&nbsp;system/language/english/</li>
	<li>3)&nbsp;Copy&nbsp;all&nbsp;the&nbsp;files&nbsp;inside&nbsp;this&nbsp;folder&nbsp;to&nbsp;your&nbsp;newly&nbsp;created&nbsp;folder&nbsp;(system/language/<strong>spanish</strong>/)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Dynamic/Multiple Languages</h1>

<p>This software also has the option for the user to change the language
 themselves. The available languages are based on the translations you 
have done. A user can change the language of the site by clicking the 
Change Language link in the footer of the site.</p>

<p>You can add as many available languages are you like. You just need 
to make sure you have created the language files and folders, as 
outlined in the guide above.</p>

<p>To make a language available for selection, you need to edit the main
 config file: application/config/config.php. Look for this line:</p>

<pre>			$config['available_languages'] = array(
	          "english" =&gt; array(
		      "display_name" =&gt; "English",
		      "rtl_support" =&gt; 0
	          )
            );
</pre>

<p>This is where you need to add your other languages. For example, to add your French language, edit the code so it says:</p>

<pre>			$config['available_languages'] = array(
	          "english" =&gt; array(
		      "display_name" =&gt; "English",
		      "rtl_support" =&gt; 0
	          ),
              "french" =&gt; array(
		      "display_name" =&gt; "French",
		      "rtl_support" =&gt; 0
	          )
            );
</pre>

<p>Now when the user visits the Change Language page, the option for 
French will appear in the menu. Remember, make sure the language files 
(in this case French) have been added too as outlined in the Language 
Guide above.</p>

<p><strong>RTL-SUPPORT</strong>: If you need to enable right-to-left 
text, for your language you need to change "rtl_support" =&gt; 0 to 
"rtl_support" =&gt; 1. This will then set the page to change text to 
RTL.</p>

<h3 id="document-26">PayPal Setup - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Welcome to the Setup Paypal Guide. This guide is used to setup your 
PayPal account so that you can use the micro-transactions feature on the
 software.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you first need a PayPal account and have 
installed the software. Login to your system as the admin and go to 
Payment Settings option in the Admin Panel.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_3.png"></p>

<p>Enter your PayPal account email in the PayPal Email field. Whenever 
someone tries to buy funds, this is the account that has the money 
deposited into.</p>

<h3>PayPal IPN Setup</h3>

<p>Now you need to go to PayPal.com and turn on your IPN. IPN stands for
 the Instant Payment Notification system and it is used to automatically
 add the credits to user accounts when they purchase them (making it so 
you don't have to manually give each user the credits yourself.).</p>

<p>First login to your Paypal account. Click on the Profile link in the 
top-right corner and navigate to My Profile settings page. You should 
see a host of options in the left sidebar now.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_4.png"></p>

<p>click on the My Selling Preferences and find the Instant Payment Notifications Update link.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_5.png"></p>

<p>Now you need to enable and turn on IPN messages. In the Notification 
URL you need to enter the domain name you are using to host the system 
along with: IPN/process2. So if I had installed the&nbsp; software on 
http://framework.patchesoft.com/ my URL would be: 
http://framework.patchesoft.com/IPN/process2</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_6.png"></p>

<p>Save the settings. Once done, you should now be able to receive 
payments and your users should automatically be receiving their funds. 
If you're having issues, try checking the IPN History page in PayPal 
which shows any requests it is trying to send out, along with any error 
messages/issues: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_display-ipns-history">https://www.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_display-ipns-history</a></p>

<h3 id="document-27">Social Media Login Setup - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>This software allows for users to login to the system via Twitter, 
Facebook and Google. This guide aims to help you activate this feature. 
You can disable Social Logins via the Admin Panel. In order for the 
social login to work, you need to add the correct Social Network keys to
 your admin area. This guide will show you where you can obtain these 
keys and where they need to go. Users that login via Social Networks 
just have to click the Login With Twitter/Facebook/Google buttons and 
the System will connect to the social network to obtain their user 
information and log them into the system. All the user has to do is 
click and it allows them to use the System without having to enter lots 
of information on the registration page</p>

<p>In order to implement the Twitter Social Login, you will need to get the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Twitter Consumer Key</li>
	<li>Twitter Consumer Secret</li>
</ul>

<p>To get this information, you need to create your own App at the Twitter Developer's website: <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">https://dev.twitter.com/</a>. It's free to do and easy to setup.</p>

<p>First you will want to head to the Twitter Developer site and login 
using your Twitter Account. Once your logged in, head over to <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/">https://apps.twitter.com/</a>. Click the Create New App button in the right corner.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_7.png"></p>

<p>Next you want to fill out your App Information. In the Callback URL 
field, you want to enter your website URL followed by 
/login/twitter_login_pro; so if your website URL was 
http://www.patchesoft.com, the URL you would enter would be 
http://www.patchesoft.com/login/twitter_login_pro</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_8.png"></p>

<p>Once created, click on the API tab.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_9.png"></p>

<p>On the API Tab, scroll to the bottom to find the Create My Access 
Token button. Click it. Your tokens will then be generated; it may take a
 few minutes for them to appear on the page. Just refresh every couple 
of minutes until you come to a page like the one below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_10.png"></p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_11.png"></p>

<p>Now click on Keys And Access Tokens tab. Now you need to enter the 
keys from your app into the Admin Panel of your System. You can find the
 Twitter Settings under the Social Settings link.</p>

<h3><strong>Facebook</strong></h3>

<p>In order to implement the Facebook Social Login, you will need to get the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Facebook APP ID</li>
	<li>Facebook APP Secret</li>
</ul>

<p>To get this information, you need to create your own Facebook App at 
the Facebook Developer's website: https://developers.facebook.com/</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_12.png"></p>

<p>Click on the APPs tab and select Create a new app</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_13.png"></p>

<p>Give your App a name. You can ignore the namespace field. Select a category and then hit the Create button.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_14.png"></p>

<p>On the above page you will be able to get your Facebook APP ID and 
Facebook APP Secret. Then you need to add them to the System in the 
Admin Panel. You can find the Facebook Keys under the Social Media Tab.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_15.png"></p>

<p>The final step is to click on the Settings tab on the Facebook 
Developers page and then click the Advanced Top Tab. Scroll to the 
bottom and find the Valid OAuth redirect URIs and add in your websites 
URL as shown above.</p>

<h3><strong>Google</strong></h3>

<p>In order to implement the Google Social Login, you will need to get the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Google Client ID</li>
	<li>Google Client Secret</li>
</ul>

<p>To get this information, you need to create your own Google App at 
the Google Developer's website: https://console.developers.google.com</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_16.png"></p>

<p>Click Create A Project. Give your project a name and Accept the Terms Of Use.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_17.png" style="height:720px; width:956px"></p>

<p>Next click on the API &amp; Auths tab and then the Credentials Tab. 
Click on the Create New Client ID button and fill in your information. 
For the Authorized redirect URI enter your domain name followed by

http://www.example.com/login/google_login. For the Authorized JavaScript
 origins just enter your website's URL.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_18.png"></p>

<p>Once created you will find your Client ID and Client Secret values.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_19.png"></p>

<p>The final step is to make sure the Google+ API setting is set to ON. Check out the scrrenshot below.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_20.png"></p>

<p>Now you have both keys and can add them to the System. Go to the 
Admin Panel and locate the Social Media Link to find the place where to 
insert the keys.</p>

<hr>
<p>Welcome to the Update Guide. This guide is to help you update your 
system to the latest version. We know that a lot of our customers do 
their own custom updates to their systems and so having to overwrite 
their files all the time can sometimes cause them problems. This update 
guide is to show you which files need to be updated in order for your 
system to be fully updated.</p>

<p><strong>BEFORE UPDATING, PLEASE MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR EXISTING 
FILES/DATABASE! SOME UPDATES WILL OVERWRITE/DELETE OLD DATA THAT MAY BE 
USEFUL TO YOU!</strong></p>
