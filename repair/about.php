							<p class="text-dark">
								Using Fikxers’ simple, easy-to-use web-based integrated facilities maintenance application will help an organization, facilities or home operate much more efficiently and allow a much higher level of service delivery. The residential estate version of this application allows residents to log on to request any maintenance or repair service with ability to track the requests as they are completed. Keeping track of work order history for home appliances, equipment and general maintenance costs (labor and parts) will lead to a reduction of the total cost of maintenance for homes. Payment and tracking of estate levies by residents is also possible on Fikxers.
